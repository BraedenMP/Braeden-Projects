		<h4>Bio</h4>
		<p class="bio"> My name is Braeden Plein and I am a student. While this may be true in terms of high school, I am also a student of the internet. When I am not doing math equations or repairing computers I am learning web development.  There is just something captivating about computers that  makes me want to figure them out, and then make them do what I want. But much of this passion has been fuelled by being a Computer Technician at the University of Waterloo. The journey was long, filled with ups and downs, and spit me out a computer wizardâ€¦ or so I like to think.</p>
