				  	<h3>Just Wired</h3>
				  	<p>Just Wired is a small business, founded and run completely by Barb Main. Barb began Just Wired as an artistic hobby from her home and has slowly developed it into a small business. Just Wired is a beaded jewelry business with focus on creating authentic, handcrafted, wearable art. 
				  			<br /> <br/>
					Barb was looking to expand her business from a local jewelry provider to a world wide business. This would mean a functional e-commerce website that would bring in new customers, while providing an enjoyable user experience. From strategy to launch this project was about creating an amazing user directed website that would convey what Just Wired is all about.</p>

	  <h2 id="modalTitle">Just Wired</h2>
	  <br/><p class="lead">Research</p>
	  <p>The research process meant getting to know and understand Barb's typical customer. By understanding their goals, desires and expectations I was able to tailor the website in their favour. I also did research on Barb's online competition. Getting to know what they do right and what they fail to do gave me a great advantage in creating a website that would stand out and speak directly to the customer.</p><br/>
	  <p class="lead">Design</p>
	  <p>While sketching a design I wanted to implement what the typical user would want to see. This meant a flashy header, well laid out text, and ease of use. I modeled the product pages after similar retail websites but gave it a cleaner look. White space and hidden text makes the user feel more comfortable on a web page and increases the feeling of ease when working with the website. I wanted the friction of learning to use the website to be as little as possible so they can view and purchase products easily without frustration.</p><br/>
	  <p class="lead">Interactivity</p>
	  <p>Websites that allow the user to interact in subtle ways increase user attention and make them more likely to keep exploring the web page. This in my opinion is one of the most important parts of the website. Upon landing on the page the header will scroll into place to instantly separate the website from competitors. For certain content I added a fade up affect, triggered when users scroll. This affect makes users feel rewarded for scrolling down and increases their desire to see more.</p><br/>
	  <p class="lead">Production</p> 
	  <p>I implemented and refined all of my research, strategy and design by making it into a practical and aesthetically pleasing website. I also created a way to manage the website efficiently. Adding new products requires little time or effort so Barb, having little knowledge about website code, can manage the website on her own.</p><br/>
